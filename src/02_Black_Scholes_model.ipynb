    "## Definitions and demonstrations\n",
    "The price stochastic process is: $$\\frac{dS(t)}{S(t)}=\\mu dt+\\sigma dW^{\\mathbb{P}}(t)$$Where $\\mathbb{P}$ represents real-world measure opposite to $\\mathbb{Q}$ which is the risk-neutral measure.\n",
    "<br>The bank account follows this ODE: $$\\frac{dM(t)}{M(t)}=rdt\\Rightarrow M(t)=M_{t_0}\\times e^{rt}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We first define $V(t,S(t))$ which represents the value of the option at time $t$. Then we consider a trading strategy under which one holds one option and continuously trade in the stock in order to hold some $\\Delta (t)$ shares. At time $t$ the portfolio value is : $$\\Pi(t,S(t))=V(t,S(t))-\\Delta (t)S(t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $S(t)$ is stochastic the portfolio is stochastic as well, then the dynamic of our portfolio using the Ito's lemma is: $$d\\Pi=dV-\\Delta dS(t)=r\\Pi dt \\space\\space\\space\\space(1)$$ \n",
    "We need to find $dV$, with Ito's lemma ($dt^2=0, dW(t)^2=dt$) we have: $$dV=\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S(t)}dS(t)+\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t}dt+\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial S(t)^2}dS(t)^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We replace by the $dS(t)$ and obtain the following: $$dV=\\biggl( \\mu S(t)\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S(t)}+\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t}+\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 S(t)^2\\frac{\\partial ^2 V}{\\partial S(t)^2}\\biggl) dt+\\sigma S(t)\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S(t)}dW(t)$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we replace in th  $(1)$ equation and obtain the following:\n",
    "$$d\\Pi=\\biggl( \\mu S(t)\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S(t)}+\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t}+\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 S(t)^2\\frac{\\partial ^2 V}{\\partial S(t)^2}\\biggl) dt+\\sigma S(t)\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S(t)}dW(t) -\\Delta(t)(\\mu S(t)dt+\\sigma S(t)dW(t))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Or we want to hedge the risk (removing the uncertainty), we should set: $$\\Delta(t)=\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S(t)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then with $$d\\Pi=r\\Pi dt$$ we further obtain: $$r\\Pi dt = \\biggl( \\mu S(t)\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S(t)}+\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t}+\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 S(t)^2\\frac{\\partial ^2 V}{\\partial S(t)^2}\\biggl) dt-\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S(t)}(\\mu S(t)dt)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By getting ride of certain terms we have: $$ \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t}+\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2S^2\\frac{\\partial^2V}{\\partial S^2}-r\\Pi=0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However with $\\Pi=V-\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S}S$ we obtain:$$ \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t}+\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2S^2\\frac{\\partial^2V}{\\partial S^2}-r\\biggl(V-\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S}S \\biggl)=0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we obtain a parabolic partial differential equation (for European option):$$\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t}+\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2S^2\\frac{\\partial^2V}{\\partial S^2}+rS\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S}-rV=0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This a differential equation for the $V$ with initial and terminal conditions: $V_{call}(T)=max(S(T)-K,0);V_{put}(T)=max(K-S(T),0)$. The fair value of this an option (risk free) doesn't depend on $\\mu$, **great thing** ! Options are driven by volatility, maturity, ... \n",

    "- The asset price follow a lognormal random walk (GBM).\n",
    "- Interest rete $r$ and volatility $\\sigma$ are known function of $t$.\n",
    "- Transaction cost are not included in the model\n",
    "- No dividend paid during the option's life\n",
